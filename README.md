# HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refractor-Challenge-


## Description
Refactor Challenge in HTML and CSS.
The purpose of this project was to refactor existing code provided to me by a marketing agency. The agency hired me to refactor an existing website to make it more **accessible**, to help people with disabilities, and to also improve the website's position in search engine results.
My aim during this project was to improve accessibility by including semantic elements and selectors instead of generic div containers, applying accessible alt attributes to images and icons, and applying a concise and descriptive title. I also employed the **Scout Rule** during my work and tried to tidy and clean the code to the best of my ability. I did this by ensuring the HTML elements follow a logical structure and by ensuring that selectors within the style sheet fell in sequential order in relation to the HTML file. I also included comment annotations throughout the code to display any changes I have made and explain my reasoning.
Ultimately, there was no visual change to the webpage, as that was not my goal and not what I was hired for; instead, the changes I have made go on behind the scenes and have improved accessibility for search engine optimisation and functionality with screen readers.
