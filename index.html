<!--Replaced variety of div elements with semantic elements instead for better readability and accessibility. Also removed trailing slashes and stray end tags to avoid bad interactions with unquoted attribute values, and to help accessibility with screen readers. Tidied up indentation for better readability. -->

<!--Added horiseon title, and added alternate text for images and icons. Added tab indices to improve screen reader functionality-->
